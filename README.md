# open3d and realsense project

This project contains two Python files:
- `virtualmouseopen3d.py`: Python code to control a 3D mouse using air gestures.
- `textinpcd.py`: Python code to create a 3D model of a text with a shadow.

## virtualmouseopen3d.py

This Python file contains the code to control a 3D mouse using air gestures. The code requires an air-based 3D mouse to be connected to the computer. The mouse can be used to control the movements of 3D objects in an application.

### Requirements
- install requirements.txt file

### Usage of virtualmouseopen3d.py
1. Connect intel realsense camera to the computer.
2. Run `virtualmouseopen3d.py`.
3. Use air gestures to control the 3D mouse.


## textinpcd.py

This Python file contains the code to create a 3D model of a text with a shadow. The code uses the Pygame library to create a 3D model of the text and the shadow.

### Requirements
- open3d library

### Usage
1. Install the open3d library if it is not already installed: `pip install open3d-python`.
2. Run `textinpcd.py`.
3. Enter the text you want to create the 3D model for.
4. The program will generate a 3D model of the text with a shadow.

## Conclusion
This project contains two Python files that demonstrate the use of air-based 3D mouse and open3d library for creating a 3D model of text with shadow. Feel free to use and modify the code for your own projects.
